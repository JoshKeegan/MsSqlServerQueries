Queries To Consider Writing:

------------------------------
Identify FillFactor Candidates
------------------------------
Once the Index Maintenance script has been running for a while, write a query 
to check master.CommandLog for indexes that are frequently becoming fragmented.
These are then candidates for lowering fillfactor from the default of 100 
(actually stored as 0, but easier to think of as 100).
This script could then be manually run once a month to check to see if the current
FillFactor values on any indexes should be lowered in order to reduce fragmentation.
This would obviously be a gradual process as FillFactor was dropped just a few percent at a time.
